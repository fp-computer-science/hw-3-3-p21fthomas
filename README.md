### Inputs
---

Answer each of the following questions in a separate Python file named `hw3-3-#.py` where `#` is the number of the question. In your heading, put your name and the date you began working on the file. Be sure to write each program in a way that allows you to swap values to make the program more versatile.


1. Write a Python program that prompts the user to input a temperature in Fahrenheit, converts this temperature to Celsius, and displays the result.

2. Write a Python program that will prompt the user to enter the radius and height of a cylinder, calculate the surface area and volume of the cylinder, and then display the results. Hint: *Volume of a cylinder =  π r <sup>2</sup>* h and *Surface Area of a cylinder = 2 π r (h + r)*

3. Rewrite the program you created in HW 2-2 to prompt the user to input the number of free throws, 2 pointers, and 3 pointers that were scored by the player.
